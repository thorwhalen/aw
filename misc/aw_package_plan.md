Here is the architecture and design based on your requirements, preferences, and the excellent research you've provided.

### üéØ Architecture & Design Takeaways

Your requirements and research converge on a robust, modern agentic architecture. My key takeaways are:

1.  **`CodeAct` is the Core Action:** For both loading and preparation, the agent's primary action should not be rigid tool calls but the **generation of Python code** (i.e., `pandas` snippets). This provides the flexibility needed to handle the messy, unpredictable nature of real-world data sources.
2.  **DVC Solves the "Hard Problem":** Your "inplace vs. copy" dilemma regarding state management and "rewind" is a classic data engineering trap. Your research hit the nail on the FOSS\_Tools\_for\_Thought/Data\_Version\_Control\_DVC.md: **Data Version Control (DVC)**. Using a tool like **`lakeFS`** or **`DVC`** is the correct architectural answer. It provides Git-like, atomic commits for your data, making "rewind" a simple "checkout" operation.
3.  **Validation is the `Observation`:** The `ReAct` pattern (Reason $\rightarrow$ Action $\rightarrow$ Observation) is the perfect fit. The "validation" you describe *is* the `Observation` step. The agent acts (generates code), the code runs, and the validator's output (whether a `success: true` or a `Traceback: CParserError...`) is fed back as the observation, driving the next "Thought" (self-correction/retry).
4.  **Specialize with Multi-Agents:** Your instincts and research are correct. Decouple the tasks into specialized agents. I propose a **LoadingAgent** (the "Analyst") and a **PreparationAgent** (the "Programmer"). The `cosmo` validation itself can be a third, internal **ValidatorTool** (the "QA Tester") that the `PreparationAgent` calls.
5.  **LLMs See Metadata, Not Big Data:** The LLM agent should *never* be fed the full DataFrame. It should only see metadata (file extensions, byte samples, `df.info()`, `df.head()`) to inform its "Thought" and "Action" (code generation). The generated code is then executed on the *full* data in a separate, sandboxed environment.

### üèóÔ∏è Proposed Architecture

I propose a unified `AgenticStep` protocol that both `LoadingAgent` and `PreparationAgent` implement. State is managed externally via a Data Version Control (DVC) system.

#### 1\. The `AgenticStep` Protocol (The Unified Pattern)

This is the "reusable schema" you asked for. Every major step in your chain will be an object (or function) that adheres to this structure.

  * **Configuration (`dataclass`):**

      * `llm: Union[str, Callable]` (e.g., "gpt-4o" or `oa.chat`): The "ask AI" dependency.
      * `validator: Union[Callable, PydanticModel]` (e.g., `is_dataframe_not_empty` or a `CosmoSchema`): The "pass/fail" check.
      * `tools: List[Callable]`: A list of functions the agent can use (e.g., `code_interpreter`, `file_sampler`).
      * `max_retries: int = 3`: Your retry parameter.
      * `human_in_loop: bool = False`: Your HITL parameter.

  * **Core Method: `execute(input, context)`:**

    1.  **Loop (`max_retries`):**
    2.  **Reason (Thought):** Agent uses `llm` to analyze `input` and `context.history` to generate a `thought` and an `action` (e.g., Python code).
    3.  **Act (Action):** The `action` (code) is run using the `CodeInterpreterTool`.
    4.  **Observe (Observation):**
          * If the code fails: `observation = traceback_str`.
          * If code succeeds: `observation = data_artifact` (e.g., a `df`).
    5.  **Validate:** The `validator` runs on the `observation`.
          * If `validator.check(observation) == True`: The loop breaks. The agent has succeeded.
          * If `validator.check(observation) == False`: The `validation_error` is fed back as the `observation` for the next loop.
    6.  **Human-in-the-Loop:** If `human_in_loop` is True or the agent *decides* it needs help (e.g., after `max_retries`), it pauses and requests input.
    7.  **Output:** Returns `(output_artifact, output_metadata)`.

#### 2\. State Management & Rewind (Your "Hard Problem" Solved)

We will not use in-memory history or `inplace=True`. We will use a DVC system like **`lakeFS`** (which has a Python API) for robust, immutable state management.

  * **Workflow:**
    1.  **Start:** Orchestrator creates a new `lakeFS` branch for this job (e.g., `job-123`).
    2.  **LoadingAgent Success:** The agent's resulting `df` is saved to the data lake (e.g., as `raw.parquet`) and **committed** to the `job-123` branch with the tag `"LOADED"`. This is your first rewind point.
    3.  **PreparationAgent Execution:** This agent reads the `"LOADED"` data. Its `CodeInterpreterTool` *always* operates on a *copy* (or a `lakeFS` view). It *never* modifies the committed `"LOADED"` file.
    4.  **PreparationAgent Failure:** The agent's code fails. No problem. The `"LOADED"` data is untouched. The agent simply gets the traceback and tries again, reading from the same pristine `"LOADED"` data.
    5.  **PreparationAgent Success:** The final, validated `df` is saved (e.g., as `prepared.parquet`) and **committed** with the tag `"PREPARED"`.
  * **"Rewind" is now trivial:** To rewind to the state after loading, you simply check out the `"LOADED"` commit. This is infinitely more robust than in-memory management.

#### 3\. Concrete Agents for Your Use Case

**A. LoadingAgent (The "Data Analyst")**

  * **Goal:** Turn a `source_uri` into a `pandas.DataFrame`.
  * **Tools:**
      * `CodeInterpreterTool`: To run `pandas` code (e.g., `pd.read_csv`, `pd.read_json`).
      * `FileSamplerTool`: To read file extensions and the first N bytes/lines of a file (local or remote, using `graze`).
  * **Process:**
    1.  `Input:` `source_uri = "http://.../data.xls"`
    2.  `Thought:` "I need to load this. I'll use `FileSamplerTool` to check the extension."
    3.  `Action:` `FileSamplerTool(source_uri)`
    4.  `Observation:` `{'extension': '.xls', 'sample_bytes': b'...'}`
    5.  `Thought:` "It's an Excel file. I should use `pd.read_excel`. I'll try with the default parameters on a sample first to see the columns."
    6.  `Action (Code):` `df = pd.read_excel(source_uri, nrows=50); print(df.info())`
    7.  `Observation:` (Output of `df.info()`: column names, dtypes, nulls)
    8.  `Thought:` "Looks good. Now I'll load the whole thing."
    9.  `Action (Code):` `df = pd.read_excel(source_uri)`
    10. `Validate:` `basic_validator(df)` (e.g., "is it a non-empty DataFrame?").
    11. `Output:` `(df, {'info': df.info(), 'dtypes': ...})`.
    12. **Orchestrator:** `lakefs.commit(df, "LOADED")`.

**B. PreparationAgent (The "Data Programmer")**

  * **Goal:** Transform the raw `df` to be `cosmo`-compatible.
  * **Tools:**
      * `CodeInterpreterTool`: To run `pandas` transformation code (e.g., `df.dropna()`, `df['new_col'] = ...`).
      * `CosmoValidatorTool`: A custom tool that *is* your functional validator.
  * **Process:**
    1.  `Input:` `df` (from `"LOADED"` commit), `context` (which includes the goal: "make ready for cosmograph").
    2.  `Thought:` "`cosmo` needs two numeric columns for x/y. The `df.info()` shows `col_A` (int) and `col_C` (float). I'll try those. I must also drop nulls in those columns."
    3.  `Action (Code):` `transformed_df = df.dropna(subset=['col_A', 'col_C'])`
    4.  `Validate (Action):` `CosmoValidatorTool(transformed_df, x_col='col_A', y_col='col_C')`
    5.  **Inside `CosmoValidatorTool`:**
          * `try:`
          * `cosmograph.cosmo(df, points_x_by=x_col, points_y_by=y_col, ...)`
          * `return {'success': True, 'params': {'x': x_col, 'y': y_col}}`
          * `except Exception as e:`
          * `return {'success': False, 'error_message': str(e)}`
    6.  `Observation (from Tool):` `{'success': False, 'error_message': "TypeError: 'col_C' contains strings."}`
    7.  `Thought:` "The validator failed. `col_C` has strings. I need to convert it to numeric, coercing errors."
    8.  `Action (Code):`
        ```python
        transformed_df = df.copy()
        transformed_df['col_C'] = pd.to_numeric(transformed_df['col_C'], errors='coerce')
        transformed_df = transformed_df.dropna(subset=['col_A', 'col_C'])
        ```
    9.  `Validate (Action):` `CosmoValidatorTool(transformed_df, x_col='col_A', y_col='col_C')`
    10. `Observation (from Tool):` `{'success': True, 'params': {'x': 'col_A', 'y': 'col_C'}}`
    11. `Thought:` "Success. I am done."
    12. `Output:` `(transformed_df, {'cosmo_params': {'x': 'col_A', 'y': 'col_C'}})`
    13. **Orchestrator:** `lakefs.commit(transformed_df, "PREPARED")`.

This architecture directly uses your research, fulfills your requirements for validation and state, and leverages your preferred `oa` package (which can be the default implementation for the `llm` parameter).
