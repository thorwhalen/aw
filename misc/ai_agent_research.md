The documents offer significant insights into the architecture, design patterns, and tooling for building robust AI agents for data-centric tasks.

### üß† Core Agentic Design Patterns

Your requirements, particularly the "chain of steps" with "validation, max retries, and human-in-the-loop," align perfectly with established agent architectures:

* **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) Pattern:** This is the foundational pattern for decision-making in agents. The LLM interleaves **thought** (e.g., "I need to find a suitable loader by checking the file extension"), **action** (e.g., "run file\_info\_tool"), and **observation** (e.g., "file is a .csv") in an iterative loop until it reaches a solution. Frameworks like **CrewAI** and **LangChain** use this by default.
    * **Application:** Your **Loading Data** agent would use a ReAct loop to iteratively try different loading parameters or loaders, capturing traceback errors as the "observation" to inform its next "thought".
* **Self-Reflection and Correction (Validation Loops):** This is the core mechanism for **auto-retry**. The agent produces an output (e.g., transformed data or code), a validation check runs, and if it fails (e.g., "output didn't match the schema"), the error is fed back to the LLM to **correct its approach and try again**. This is key for your "max num of tries" and validation steps.
* **Plan-and-Execute Pattern:** For an entire chain of steps (Finding $\rightarrow$ Sourcing $\rightarrow$ Loading $\rightarrow$ Preparing), this pattern can provide a useful high-level structure. A "Planner" agent first creates a detailed sequence of steps, and an "Executor" then carries them out one by one.
    * **Application:** A top-level agent could be a "Planner" that coordinates the *Loading Agent* and the *Preparation Agent* in a deterministic sequence.
* **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Splitting the workflow into dedicated agents (a **Loading Agent**, a **Preparation Agent**, and a potential **Visualization Validation Agent**) is explicitly recommended. This allows each agent to have a **specific, narrow focus** (reducing hallucinations/improving accuracy) and set of tools.

### üî® Tools, Frameworks, and Programming Concepts

| Area | Concept/Tool | Relevance to Your Design | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Orchestration** | **LangChain** / **DSPy** / **CrewAI** | These Python frameworks are the **core foundation** for defining the agents, their internal loops (ReAct), and the sequence of steps (CrewAI's `Crew`/`Flow` or LangChain's chains). | |
| **Structured Output** | **Pydantic Models** / **JSON Schema** | The *simplest, most robust way* to define the **contract** for both input/output data and agent parameters. Used for validating outputs and guiding the LLM (e.g., in CrewAI and DSPy). | |
| **Data Handling (Code Execution)** | **Code Interpreter Tool** / **PandasAI** | Your **Loading** and **Preparation** steps require running Python code (specifically `pandas`). The `CodeInterpreterTool` allows the agent to execute code in a secure sandbox. **PandasAI** is a tool that directly enables the LLM to generate `pandas` code from natural language instructions. | |
| **Validation** | **Great Expectations** / **Pydantic** | Tools to run explicit data quality checks (your "run some computation") after the data is loaded/prepared. If tests fail, the agent is alerted and retries. | |
| **Tool Interface** | **`@tool` decorator** / **BaseTool** | Frameworks provide a clear convention to turn a Python function into an agent-callable tool. This is your "reusable schema for the interface" to enable agents to search, download, or run code. | |
| **Parameterization** | **Nested Configuration** | The use of LLM wrappers like `LLM(model="ollama/deepseek-r1")` within agent definitions shows a pattern of overriding global/default LLM configurations at the agent level. | |

### üéØ Data Preparation Focus: The Hard Problem (Immutability/Rewind)

The problem of managing **mutable state** (`inplace` transformations on a `pandas` DataFrame) versus **undo/rewind** capabilities is a classic data engineering challenge. The provided documents focus more on the *generation of the transformation logic* (the code) rather than the *execution management of the data itself*.

* **Focus on Code Generation:** The recommended pattern is for the LLM agent to analyze a **small sample** of data and the **target schema** (your `cosmo` requirements) and then **generate a Python script** that, when executed *on the full dataset*, performs the required transformation.
* **Immutability/Copy Strategy (Implicit):** In the provided examples, the assumption is generally **immutable** operations (working on copies or re-running from a defined state). The failure loop reruns the process, either by re-running the modified code on the original data or by simply taking the exception/error from the last run, correcting the logic, and running again.
    * **Recommended Simple Pattern:** Given the lack of a clear tool for intelligent, memory-aware undo/redo within the agent frameworks: **work only on copies (or re-execute from the start)**. When the agent generates a new transformation, it runs it on the pristine loaded DataFrame (or a direct copy). This ensures reliable "rewind" to the last correct state (the loaded DataFrame) at the cost of some re-computation.

## üí° Deep Research Prompt Proposal

Based on your context, the most critical missing pieces relate to a **robust framework for data state management (rewind/copy)** and specialized tools for the **visualization-specific validation**.

Here is a proposed prompt to search for the missing pieces:
The research you've conducted highlights key concepts for your ambitious data preparation agent:

* **Code Generation for Action:** The **CodeAct** pattern reinforces the idea of the LLM generating *executable Python code* to perform complex actions (like data loading and transformation) instead of using rigid JSON-based tools. This is ideal for handling the flexibility of `pandas` and the complex logic of your two main agents.
* **Decoupled Agent Roles:** The **HexMachina** and multi-agent visualization systems strongly suggest separating the cognitive load into distinct roles: a **Planner/Coordinator** (which you have), a **Header Getter/Analyst Agent** (for the loading step), a **Programmer Agent** (for code generation/prep), and an **Image Reader/Validator Agent** (for the visualization check).
* **Memory for Scale and Debugging:** The consensus is to offload memory outside the prompt context. For large data, the LLM should only see **data samples** or **metadata** (like column names/types) to reduce token usage. For agents to self-correct, they need a simple **buffer/list to track actions** and **error messages (observations)**.

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Design: Loading and Preparation

The design of your `Loading Data` and `Preparing Data` steps should be rooted in a **CodeAct/ReAct loop** using Python objects for state and a robust **Data Version Control (DVC)** tool for the "rewind" capability.

### 1. Unified Step Architecture: The `AgenticStep` Pattern

All your steps (Loading, Preparation, etc.) should conform to a base `AgenticStep` class that handles the boilerplate:

* **Input $\rightarrow$ Agent Core $\rightarrow$ Output Loop (ReAct/Self-Correction):**
    * **Input:** The agent receives its initial input (e.g., `source_uri` for loading, `data_frame` for preparation) + the `Context` (memory).
    * **LLM Generates Thought + Action (Code):** The LLM reasons about the task (e.g., "Thought: I should try `pd.read_csv` with delimiter `comma`") and generates an executable **Python code block** (`Action: code...`).
    * **Tool Execution:** The generated code runs in a sandbox (`CodeInterpreterTool`).
    * **Observation/Validation:**
        * **If Code Fails:** The traceback error is the `Observation` fed back to the LLM to generate a new "Thought" and "Action" (self-correction/retry).
        * **If Code Succeeds:** A separate **Validator Function/Agent** runs. The result is a simple boolean (`success: bool`) and a metadata dictionary (`info: dict`).
    * **Output:** The loop breaks upon success, emitting the artifact (DataFrame, etc.) and metadata.
* **Parameters (`AgenticStep` Attributes):**
    * `llm_model: Union[str, Callable]`: Your core "ask AI" function/model override (allows defaults).
    * `max_retries: int`: Global max retries (e.g., hardcoded default of 3).
    * `validation_func: Union[Callable, PydanticModel, JSONSchema]` (or list thereof): The contract for a successful output.
    * `tools: list[BaseTool]`: The list of available tools (e.g., `CodeInterpreterTool`, `SearchTool`).
    * `human_in_loop: bool`: The flag for mandatory human review/intervention (can be made callable for dynamic decisions).

### 2. State Management: Rewind and Immutability (The **`lakeFS`** Solution)

The challenge of "inplace vs. copy" and "rewind" is best solved outside of the LLM agent using a **Data Version Control (DVC) system**.

* **Data Version Control (DVC):** Tools like **lakeFS** or **DVC (Data Version Control)** manage data changes and versions similarly to Git.
    * **`lakeFS`** provides **branching, committing, and rollback** capabilities on large datasets without creating full physical copies for every change. It is designed to work with data in object storage and supports an atomic view of your data at any point in history.
* **Pattern: Explicit Commit on Success:**
    1.  The `Loading Agent` successfully loads the raw data into a `pandas` DataFrame.
    2.  The raw data is saved to a **`lakeFS` branch**, and a **"Raw Data Loaded" commit** is made. This is your definitive starting point for rewind.
    3.  The `Preparation Agent` works by **generating and executing code that transforms a copy/view** of the committed data.
    4.  If the transformation fails, the execution is terminated, and the agent continues generating code (there is **no state to rollback** because the core data was never mutated).
    5.  If the transformation succeeds and validation passes, the resulting DataFrame is saved to the same `lakeFS` branch, and a **"Data Prepared" commit** is made.

**This approach guarantees rewind capability** by simply resetting the workspace to the "Raw Data Loaded" commit.

### 3. Concrete Step Implementations

#### **A. Loading Data Agent**

* **Goal:** Resolve `source_uri` to a validated `pandas.DataFrame`.
* **Core Logic:** Uses a **ReAct loop** with the `CodeInterpreterTool`.
    * **Initial Thought:** Check file extension (via file\_system\_tool) to guess the reader function (e.g., `pd.read_csv`, `pd.read_json`).
    * **Action:** Generate Python code to read a **small chunk/sample** (e.g., first 50 rows) to infer schema/types, as suggested by best practices for LLM data tasks.
    * **Validation 1 (Operational):** *Did the code run without Python exceptions?* (Checked by `CodeInterpreterTool` output).
    * **Validation 2 (Functional/Custom):** Run a `validation_func` over the loaded data/metadata.
        * **Pattern: Info Dict:** The function takes the DataFrame and returns a structured **`info_dict`** (e.g., `{'num_rows': 1000, 'num_null_cols': 5, 'dtypes': {...}}`). This `info_dict` is the memory artifact for downstream agents.
        * **Pattern: Action Function:** A secondary function (or a nested agent) takes the `info_dict` and decides an action (e.g., `if info['num_null_cols'] > 10: raise Warning("Too many nulls for automation.")`).

#### **B. Preparation Agent (Visualization Specific)**

* **Goal:** Transform the loaded DataFrame into one that satisfies the `cosmograph.cosmo()` prerequisites.
* **Core Logic:** Uses a **ReAct loop** with the `CodeInterpreterTool` and the `VisualizationValidationAgent` as a custom tool.
    * **Initial Input:** Loaded DataFrame + `info_dict` from loading step.
    * **Initial Thought:** "I need to ensure at least two numeric, non-null columns exist, and check if columns like `point_size_by` are available."
    * **Action:** Generate Python code to perform required transformations (e.g., dropping nulls, converting dtypes, using `astype()`, or running dimensionality reduction).
    * **Validation (Functional - Trying the Purpose):** Call an internal tool: **`cosmo_validator_tool(df)`**.
        * The `cosmo_validator_tool` acts as your **Validation Agent**. It takes the transformed `df`, tries calling `cosmo.cosmo(df, ...)` with a generated (or hardcoded) set of `points_x_by`, `points_y_by`, and captures the result:
            * **Success:** Returns a list of valid visualization mappings/parameters (the output artifact).
            * **Failure:** Captures the `cosmo` traceback (e.g., "column 'foo' is not numeric") and returns it as the **`Observation`** to the **Preparation Agent** for self-correction.

## üîç Deep Research Prompt Results

The deep research you ran yielded excellent supporting information, which addresses the most critical concerns:

| Missing Piece | Research Finding | Architectural Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data State/Rollback** | **`lakeFS`** and **DVC** provide Git-like versioning on data. | **Adopt a DVC tool.** The agent works on copies/views of a **committed** DataFrame, with success resulting in a new commit. Rollback becomes a simple `git checkout` equivalent on the data lake. |
| **Visualization Validation** | Multi-agent systems use an **Image Reader Agent** to analyze visualization outputs and validate code quality. | **Create a `VisualizationValidationAgent`** as an internal tool. This agent will attempt to call the `cosmo` function (or a proxy) and use the resulting **Python Exception/Error Message** as the `Observation` for the **Preparation Agent** to fix its generated code. |
| **Large Data Handling** | LLMs should only see **data samples** (e.g., first 50 rows) and **metadata** to generate code. | **Mandate a sampling step** within the `Loading Agent` before sending data to the LLM. The actual execution of generated code must happen in the separate `CodeInterpreterTool` on the full dataset. |

The foundation is solid: you'll orchestrate **CodeAct** agents using a framework like CrewAI/DSPy, leveraging **Pydantic** for schemas, the **Code Interpreter Tool** for execution, and a **DVC solution** for state management.

Would you like me to elaborate on the minimal boilerplate structure using Python/Pydantic, or draft a full workflow based on the `VisualizationValidationAgent` idea?
